/*
    Importance of Functions:
    1. Divide and conquer: Construct a program from smaller pieces or components 

    2. Reuse: write once and use that function again and again in the program

    3. Abstraction: Hide internal details e.g. library function

    4. To improve readability of code

    5. Reduces the size of the code, duplicate set of statement are replaced by function calls.
